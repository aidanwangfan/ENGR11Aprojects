                                            As I move on in my journey of learning 3D design and fabrication, I had the opportunity to try laser cutting for the first time. For this project, I designed a custom chassis enclosure for a small robot using Autodesk Fusion 360 and created multiple versions using both 3D printing and laser cutting. Throughout the process, I had to make several adjustments to improve the fit and function of the enclosure. I also had to ensure that key features were accessible, such as allowing the wheels to move, the sensors to detect the ground, the LEDs to be visible, the batteries to be changed, and the power button to be pressed. By going through multiple iterations and refining my design, I improved my problem-solving skills and gained a better understanding of how different manufacturing techniques impact the final product.

                    After reading the entire instruction manual, many concerns came to mind. I expected the assembly of the tracking car to be a challenging process, especially since it required careful attention to detail. Since I had never soldered in the past, I was concerned that applying too much heat could accidentally damage some of the delicate parts. Another concern was wiring because even one incorrect connection might have caused the motors or LEDs to malfunction. On top of that, I had to make sure that all the physical parts were securely attached, since any loose components could have affected the car’s stability and functionality. Overall, I anticipated that both the electrical and mechanical aspects would require patience and precision to get everything working correctly.

                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">One of the biggest strengths of the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit is that it comes with clear step-by-step instructions. Each step is explained in detail, making it easier to follow the assembly process. The instructions also include specific guidance on where to place each component, which helps prevent mistakes.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">One of the weaknesses of the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit is that it requires a lot of careful soldering, which can be difficult for beginners like me. Without prior experience, it can be a struggle to attach components properly, leading to issues with the car’s functionality. </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">If I could change the instructions for the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit, I would add more visual guides for the soldering steps. Since soldering is one of the most important parts of the assembly, clear images showing proper techniques and common mistakes would make it easier for beginners like me. This would help improve the learning process and make assembly less intimidating. </li>

                <p>
                    Before actually assembling the kit, my partner and I wanted to make sure we perfected our soldering skills. We referred to a YouTube Video that we found online and practiced on a soldering board. Furthermore, we decided to only use one of the two kits in case something went wrong then we could use the second kit. Luckily, we succeeded on our first one.

                <p>
                    To assemble the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit, we followed these <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1lEYFXJO1L.pdf" target="_blank">instructions</a>.

                <p>
                    Building the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit was both a challenging and rewarding experience. Even with all the soldering practice, we still ran into some issues during the assembly. Soldering was a bit tricky because we wanted to avoid creating solder bridges, which required extra care and precision. At one point, I accidentally burnt one of the wheels while soldering, which caused it to warp slightly. As a result, the wheel couldn’t spin properly and kept getting stuck. This affected the car’s movement, so my partner and I had to find a solution. Eventually, we replaced the damaged wheel with the spare one that we had, which solved the problem. Despite the small setback, the process taught us a lot about patience, problem solving, and the importance of careful soldering. In the end, overcoming these challenges made the final product feel even more rewarding.

                The next step of this project involved designing a chassis enclosure for the robot using 3D printing. To start, we measured the dimensions of the robot kit, using a digital caliper, to ensure the enclosure would fit properly. We then carefully planned the design to make sure it provided access to five key features. The design had to include openings for the wheels to move freely, spaces for the sensors to detect the ground, and clear areas to view the LEDs. Furthermore, we had to incorporate easy access points to change the batteries and press the power button.

                    For our first iteration, we decided to design and print a simple box. This allowed us to confirm that our measurements were accurate and that the box would fit as intended. This step helped us identify any potential sizing issues before moving forward with a more complex design.

                    Reflecting on the first iteration, the process went smoothly, and the final print fit perfectly. To ensure the print’s success, we added supports as a precaution, which proved to be a helpful decision. The supports provided extra stability, reducing the risk of failure. This successful print gave us confidence in our design process and prepared us for future iterations.

                <p>
                    By reflecting on our simple box design, we brainstormed ideas for a more complex and creative chassis. For our second iteration, we set a few goals. We wanted to improve the aesthetics while keeping the chassis lightweight to ensure the robot could still move freely. Similar to the first iteration, we began by designing a basic box. Using various tools in Fusion360, we introduced several improvements: rounding the chassis for a sleeker look and cutting out triangle-shaped windows to enhance the design. Additionally, we considered practical features, like adding large front and back windows to allow easier access to the batteries and power button.
                </p>
                <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">Reflection for Iteration 2</h4>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on our second iteration, we were happy with how the design evolved. The improved aesthetics made the chassis look more refined, and the added feature enhanced its practicality. The larger windows proved especially useful, making battery changes and accessing the power button much easier. This iteration showed clear progress from our initial design, and the successful print gave us confidence to push our ideas even further in the next version.

                <p>
                    For our final iteration, we aimed to really enhance the aesthetic appeal of the chassis while still incorporating the five essential design principles. Drawing inspiration from a UPS truck, we started with a simple box, just like iteration 1 and 2. Using the extrusion tool in Fusion360, we added key design elements such as doors, window, a roof, and a back door. The back door was included to improve access to the power switch, and we enlarged the front windows to ensure the LEDs were clearly visible. We maintained the same wheel diameter to guarantee a proper fit. The final design successfully combined functionality with visual appeal, fitting perfectly on the robot and allowing the wheels to move freely. 
                </p>
                <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">Reflection for Iteration 3</h4>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on our final iteration, we were especially proud of how polished and functional the design became. Incorporating elements like doors, a roof, and a back door gave the chassis a more complete look while improving accessibility. Enlarging the front windows was a valuable change, as it made the LEDs much easier to see. This iteration felt like the culmination of everything we learned from previous versions, resulting in a design that was both practical and visually appealing.
