                                            As I move on in my journey of learning 3D design and fabrication, I had the opportunity to try laser cutting for the first time. For this project, I designed a custom chassis enclosure for a small robot using Autodesk Fusion 360 and created multiple versions using both 3D printing and laser cutting. Throughout the process, I had to make several adjustments to improve the fit and function of the enclosure. I also had to ensure that key features were accessible, such as allowing the wheels to move, the sensors to detect the ground, the LEDs to be visible, the batteries to be changed, and the power button to be pressed. By going through multiple iterations and refining my design, I improved my problem-solving skills and gained a better understanding of how different manufacturing techniques impact the final product.

                    After reading the entire instruction manual, many concerns came to mind. I expected the assembly of the tracking car to be a challenging process, especially since it required careful attention to detail. Since I had never soldered in the past, I was concerned that applying too much heat could accidentally damage some of the delicate parts. Another concern was wiring because even one incorrect connection might have caused the motors or LEDs to malfunction. On top of that, I had to make sure that all the physical parts were securely attached, since any loose components could have affected the car’s stability and functionality. Overall, I anticipated that both the electrical and mechanical aspects would require patience and precision to get everything working correctly.

                <p>
                    Before actually assembling the kit, my partner and I wanted to make sure we perfected our soldering skills. We referred to a YouTube Video that we found online and practiced on a soldering board. Furthermore, we decided to only use one of the two kits in case something went wrong then we could use the second kit. Luckily, we succeeded on our first one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To assemble the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit, we followed these <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1lEYFXJO1L.pdf" target="_blank">instructions</a>.

                <p>
                    Building the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit was both a challenging and rewarding experience. Even with all the soldering practice, we still ran into some issues during the assembly. Soldering was a bit tricky because we wanted to avoid creating solder bridges, which required extra care and precision. At one point, I accidentally burnt one of the wheels while soldering, which caused it to warp slightly. As a result, the wheel couldn’t spin properly and kept getting stuck. This affected the car’s movement, so my partner and I had to find a solution. Eventually, we replaced the damaged wheel with the spare one that we had, which solved the problem. Despite the small setback, the process taught us a lot about patience, problem solving, and the importance of careful soldering. In the end, overcoming these challenges made the final product feel even more rewarding.

            <p style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                The next step of this project involved designing a chassis enclosure for the robot using 3D printing. To start, we measured the dimensions of the robot kit, using a digital caliper, to ensure the enclosure would fit properly. We then carefully planned the design to make sure it provided access to five key features. The design had to include openings for the wheels to move freely, spaces for the sensors to detect the ground, and clear areas to view the LEDs. Furthermore, we had to incorporate easy access points to change the batteries and press the power button.

                <p>
                    By reflecting on our simple box design, we brainstormed ideas for a more complex and creative chassis. For our second iteration, we set a few goals. We wanted to improve the aesthetics while keeping the chassis lightweight to ensure the robot could still move freely. Similar to the first iteration, we began by designing a basic box. Using various tools in Fusion360, we introduced several improvements: rounding the chassis for a sleeker look and cutting out triangle-shaped windows to enhance the design. Additionally, we considered practical features, like adding large front and back windows to allow easier access to the batteries and power button.
                </p>
                <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">Reflection for Iteration 2</h4>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on our second iteration, we were happy with how the design evolved. The improved aesthetics made the chassis look more refined, and the added feature enhanced its practicality. The larger windows proved especially useful, making battery changes and accessing the power button much easier. This iteration showed clear progress from our initial design, and the successful print gave us confidence to push our ideas even further in the next version.

                <p>
                    For our final iteration, we aimed to really enhance the aesthetic appeal of the chassis while still incorporating the five essential design principles. Drawing inspiration from a UPS truck, we started with a simple box, just like iteration 1 and 2. Using the extrusion tool in Fusion360, we added key design elements such as doors, window, a roof, and a back door. The back door was included to improve access to the power switch, and we enlarged the front windows to ensure the LEDs were clearly visible. We maintained the same wheel diameter to guarantee a proper fit. The final design successfully combined functionality with visual appeal, fitting perfectly on the robot and allowing the wheels to move freely. 
                </p>
                <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">Reflection for Iteration 3</h4>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on our final iteration, we were especially proud of how polished and functional the design became. Incorporating elements like doors, a roof, and a back door gave the chassis a more complete look while improving accessibility. Enlarging the front windows was a valuable change, as it made the LEDs much easier to see. This iteration felt like the culmination of everything we learned from previous versions, resulting in a design that was both practical and visually appealing.

                <p>
                    To begin our last step of this project, my partner and I took precise measurements from our 3-D printed version to ensure accuracy. We followed a Youtube tutorial on constructing a finger joint box for laser cutting. Our first task was setting user parameters, which provided a standardized yet adjustable framework for the chassis dimensions. With these in place, we sketched a two-point rectangle, defining its height and width before adding finger joints—three small rectangles along one short edge, connected by a line. Using the equal constraint tool, we ensured uniformity in their size, and for the depth, we applied the ply parameter to maintain a 3mm thickness. These features were mirrored onto the opposite side, and the same process was repeated for the longer edges. Once extruded to 3mm, the base was complete. Moving on to the chassis walls, we created a new component and sketched directly onto the base’s edges. The walls were extruded using (-ply) to ensure they fit correctly over the base. The long side walls were mirrored across the origin plane, while the short walls required an additional step of projecting corners for a precise fit before being mirrored as well. With all components in place, the chassis design was finalized.

                <p>
                    For our first box, we focused on making sure it fit properly over the DIY kit rather than how it looked. Once the design was finalized, we created sketches of three faces: the bottom, one long side, and one short side. These sketches were then imported into Lightburn for laser cutting preparation. In Lightburn, we copied the long and short sides to create five pieces in total. After arranging the pieces neatly, we exported the file as a .lbrn2 onto a USB drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then connected the USB to the computer used for laser cutting. After reviewing the safety guidelines, we started the cutting process.

                <p>
                    The first laser cut fit the car well, with the base fitting perfectly. However, the walls were too tall, so we went back into the user parameters to adjust the height. We changed the height parameter to 70mm to ensure a better fit. Additionally, we used the hole function to cut out a wheel well for the back tire.

                <p>
                    For the second box, we went back into Fusion 360 to make some adjustments. We began by changing the user parameters for the height from 120mm to 70mm. This reduced the height of the walls, allowing them to fit properly over the car. Another change we made was adding a hole in the roof of the box to provide access to the batteries. We used the hole tool to create a 29mm opening, which was slightly wider than the wheel well. An important step in this process was measuring the small section of the PCB located just before the wheel well to ensure everything lined up correctly.

                            In terms of improving the model, I think one key adjustment would be refining the cutouts for the wheels and sensors. By measuring those areas more precisely, we could reduce excess gaps and create a tighter fit around the key components. This would not only improve the overall look but also provide better protection for the internal parts. Another idea would be to reinforce the battery access area by adding a small hinged cover or latch to keep it secure during movement. This could be done by adding new features to the sketches and then extruding those elements to match the existing design.

                    Aside from the design improvements, one important lesson we learned was to stay organized throughout the CAD process. At one point, we accidentally deleted a key sketch layer and had trouble retracing my steps. After that, we made it a habit to label each part clearly in the timeline and create version checkpoints as we progressed. This small habit saved us a lot of time and stress later on. Overall, this stage of the project went smoothly, and I felt more confident working with Fusion 360 after overcoming these challenges.
