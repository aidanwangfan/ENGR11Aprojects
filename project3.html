                                            As I move on in my journey of learning 3D design and fabrication, I had the opportunity to try laser cutting for the first time. For this project, I designed a custom chassis enclosure for a small robot using Autodesk Fusion 360 and created multiple versions using both 3D printing and laser cutting. Throughout the process, I had to make several adjustments to improve the fit and function of the enclosure. I also had to ensure that key features were accessible, such as allowing the wheels to move, the sensors to detect the ground, the LEDs to be visible, the batteries to be changed, and the power button to be pressed. By going through multiple iterations and refining my design, I improved my problem-solving skills and gained a better understanding of how different manufacturing techniques impact the final product.

                <p class="challenge-paragraph" style="margin-top: -10px;">
                    After reading the entire instruction manual, many concerns came to mind. I expected the assembly of the tracking car to be a challenging process, especially since it required careful attention to detail. Since I had never soldered in the past, I was concerned that applying too much heat could accidentally damage some of the delicate parts. Another concern was wiring because even one incorrect connection might have caused the motors or LEDs to malfunction. On top of that, I had to make sure that all the physical parts were securely attached, since any loose components could have affected the car’s stability and functionality. Overall, I anticipated that both the electrical and mechanical aspects would require patience and precision to get everything working correctly.

                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">One of the biggest strengths of the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit is that it comes with clear step-by-step instructions. Each step is explained in detail, making it easier to follow the assembly process. The instructions also include specific guidance on where to place each component, which helps prevent mistakes.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">One of the weaknesses of the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit is that it requires a lot of careful soldering, which can be difficult for beginners like me. Without prior experience, it can be a struggle to attach components properly, leading to issues with the car’s functionality. </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">If I could change the instructions for the D2-5 Intelligent Tracking Car DIY Kit, I would add more visual guides for the soldering steps. Since soldering is one of the most important parts of the assembly, clear images showing proper techniques and common mistakes would make it easier for beginners like me. This would help improve the learning process and make assembly less intimidating. </li>

                    Before actually assembling the kit, my partner and I wanted to make sure we perfected our soldering skills. We referred to a Youtube Video that we found online and practiced on a soldering board. Furthermore, we decided to only use one of the two kits in case something went wrong then we could use the second kit. Luckily, we succeeded on our first one.

                                        <p>
                                            For my second 3D print (torture test), I selected a complex STL file designed to push the limits of the printer. The model included intricate details, overhangs, and thin structures, which tested the printer’s capability to handle challenging geometries.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            During the print, several issues arose, including poor adhesion on the finer details, stringing, and failure in printing the right arm cleanly. The right arm experienced deformation and an uneven surface. Through my knowledge of the 3D printer, I assume that the problems were likely caused by both support and cooling.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">1. Supports</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            The failure in the right arm was primarily due to insufficient support. Overhangs in the model, such as the outstretched arm and other unsupported sections, lacked stability during the print. Without adequate support, the filament had no base to adhere to, leading to sagging, uneven layers, and a rough finish.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">2. Cooling</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Cooling also played a role, particularly for the right arm. For small and thin structures, like the arm and fingers, the layers did not have enough time to cool and solidify before the printer moved on to the next layer. This resulted in soft, warped layers. In addition, the lack of supports worsened the deformation.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">3MF vs STL</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Finally, comparing the 3MF file (used for slicing) to the STL file (a basic design file), I learned that the key difference between these two file types is that 3MF files can store additional data, including material, color, texture, orientation, supports, and printing parameters, whereas STL files cannot. As a result, the name tag print file automatically incorporated the color change, but an STL file would not be able to do so.
                                        </p>

                                                    Both prints taught me a lot about 3D printing. The name tag was a great way to get the hang of slicing and printing, while the torture test really showed me how tricky it can be to print more complex designs. Looking ahead, I plan to tweak my settings, especially for supports and cooling, to improve the overall print quality.

                                                    With each project, I'm feeling more confident using the Prusa MINI+ and getting better at the whole process.

                                                    I’m really excited to keep experimenting with new designs and learn even more about 3D printing along the way!
