                                            Recently, I was introduced to open-source assistive technology and its role in 3D printing. For this project, I worked with a partner to create a 150% scale e-NABLE prosthetic hand using a Prusa Mini+ 3D printer and Fusion 360. I explored resources from the e-NABLE hub and the NIH 3D Print Exchange to guide the printing and assembly process. Along the way, I learned about the challenges of building functional prosthetic devices, the importance of clear documentation, and how rapid prototyping can improve assistive technology.

                                        <p>
                                            At first, I was able to fit all the parts onto two build plates, but then I realized we had to scale everything to 150%. This was important so that everyone could swap parts and assembling them would be easier. Because of this, we had to reorganize everything, and in the end, it took three build plates instead of two.
                                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the biggest issues we ran into was with the pins for the hands. Since they had such a small surface touching the build plate, they didn’t stick well. To fix this, we added three layers of rafts to make sure they stayed in place. We also used organic supports, but only on the build plate, to help support the fingers while printing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When the prints were finished, I didn’t notice any major problems, but the supports were still really hard to remove, even though they were organic supports. To make things easier in the future, the instructions could include more details on how to scale and organize parts efficiently. It would also help to have better guidelines on using supports and rafts, as well as some tips for removing supports without damaging the parts.

<!-- Paragraph to describe the assembly process -->
<h3 class="fw-bolder">Assembling the Hand and Reflection</h3>
<p>
    To assemble the hand, we used this <a href="https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/dd/6b/45/30/fc/Phoenix_v2_assembly_guide.pdf" target="_blank">PDF file</a>, which we found very helpful. We relied a ton on the pictures.
</p>
<p>
    The assembly process went smoothly overall, but we ran into a few challenges. One issue was figuring out which pins to use. Since there were no clear instructions, we had to test each pin until we found the right fit, which took extra time. Labeling the pins in the instructions would make this step much easier.
</p>
<p>
    Another challenge was bending the “thermo gauntlet,” the piece that covers the arm. We initially thought it was a simple bend, but when we tried to attach it to the hand shell, the holes didn’t align. We had to reheat and reshape it multiple times to get the correct fit.
</p>
<p>
    Tying the strings to the fingers was also tricky. The instructions were helpful, but I originally thought we needed five separate strings—one for each finger. It turned out that only two long strings were needed to control four fingers, plus one for the thumb. Since we had already cut them into four strands, we had to tie them back together. We watched a video tutorial for guidance.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, we didn’t use the palm mesh because we wanted to fit our hand inside, so we attached a handle instead. However, for those without hands, the palm mesh would be necessary and would need to be heated to create a curve. Despite these small issues, the assembly went well overall.
</p>

                                    For the next part of the project, we were asked to add a modification to our design. At this point, we wanted to design something fun and unique to modify the e-NABLE hand. After brainstorming a few ideas, we decided to add Wolverine claws to the prosthetic. My partner was immediately on board with the idea, so we proceeded with designing it. I began by sketching out the basic concept of the claw and how it would integrate with the hand.

                                    The design starts with a base that would be securely fixed to the e-NABLE hand. I incorporated a hole in the base, allowing it to be screwed into place. On top of the base, I added three half-circular shapes, each with a 10mm hole. These holes would serve as the pivot points for a hinge mechanism that would allow the claw to move. The claw itself would be divided into three movable parts, each controlled by the hinge system.

                                    This initial design is just a starting point, and I’m aware there are areas that need further refinement. For example, in my sketch, I drew the claw in a tense position, but I’ll need to smooth out the mechanism to ensure the claws can extend and retract seamlessly. There’s still work to be done to ensure the claw functions smoothly and safely, but I’m excited to continue refining the design.
