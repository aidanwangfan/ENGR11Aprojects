                                            Recently, I was introduced to the basics of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) as they relate to 3D printing. 
                                            I learned how to use the Prusa MINI+ 3D printer and Prusa Slicer software, including configuring the slicer and downloading 3D print files. 
                                            I explored how to slice a 3D file and prepared it for 3D printing (CAM), transforming digital design to physical objects. I also ran a more 
                                            difficult “torture test” to learn more about the limitations of the 3D printer.

                                <p>
                                    For my first print, using the Prusa MINI+ printer, I wanted to create a simpler project to explore its capabilities. I successfully created a 3D-printed name tag with my name, “Aidan Wang-Fan,” and achieved a crisp, clean color transition for the text. The process was pretty smooth, and I was impressed by how easily Prusa Slicer worked with the printer. The color change feature worked perfectly, adding a clean, professional-looking contrast to the text. However, the final print showed some sign of stringing. Stringing, also known as oozing, happens when small strings of filament are left behind as the extruder moves between different parts of the print. This might’ve happened because the extruder temperature was too high. For this project, we used PLA and printed at 215°C. At higher temperatures, the plastic is more likely to leak out during movement. Despite these minor setbacks, the project demonstrated the efficiency and reliability of the Prusa ecosystem, resulting in a visually appealing nametag.

                                <p>
                                    For my second 3D print (torture test), I selected a complex STL file designed to push the limits of the printer. The model included intricate details, overhangs, and thin structures, which tested the printer’s capability to handle challenging geometries.
                                </p>
                            
                                <p>
                                    During the print, several issues arose, including poor adhesion on the finer details, stringing, and failure in printing the right arm cleanly. The right arm experienced deformation and an uneven surface. Through my knowledge of the 3D printer, I assume that the problems were likely caused by both support and cooling.
                                </p>
                            
                                <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">1. Supports</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The failure in the right arm was primarily due to insufficient support. Overhangs in the model, such as the outstretched arm and other unsupported sections, lacked stability during the print. Without adequate support, the filament had no base to adhere to, leading to sagging, uneven layers, and a rough finish.
                                </p>
                            
                                <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">2. Cooling</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Cooling also played a role, particularly for the right arm. For small and thin structures, like the arm and fingers, the layers did not have enough time to cool and solidify before the printer moved on to the next layer. This resulted in soft, warped layers. In addition, the lack of supports worsened the deformation.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h4 class="fw-bolder mt-4">3MF vs STL</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Finally, comparing the 3MF file (used for slicing) to the STL file (a basic design file), I learned that the key difference between these two file types is that 3MF files can store additional data, including material, color, texture, orientation, supports, and printing parameters, whereas STL files cannot. As a result, the name tag print file automatically incorporated the color change, but an STL file would not be able to do so.
                                </p>

                                                    Both prints taught me a lot about 3D printing. The name tag was a great way to get the hang of slicing and printing, while the torture test really showed me how tricky it can be to print more complex designs. Looking ahead, I plan to tweak my settings, especially for supports and cooling, to improve the overall print quality.

                                                    With each project, I'm feeling more confident using the Prusa MINI+ and getting better at the whole process.

                                                    I’m really excited to keep experimenting with new designs and learn even more about 3D printing along the way!
